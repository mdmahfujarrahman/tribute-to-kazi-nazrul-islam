                    Islam, Kazi Nazrul (1899-1976) national poet of Bangladesh,
                    called the 'rebel poet' for his brave resistance to all
                    forms of repression. His poetry, with its vibrant rhythms
                    and iconoclastic themes, forms a striking contrast to
                    rabindranath tagore's poetry.
